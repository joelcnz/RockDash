Rock Dash

Bugs:
1. Can wipe out a rock on the bottom (maybe to do with diamond maker under there)
2. Reloading the level can miss a rock popping up

Remake of Rock Dash 5 (from Amstrad days)

Using Foxid layer: https://github.com/TodNaz/Foxid

Install:
You'll need to have Simple Direct Media Layer installed. Clone this and JMisc. Go into its root folder and run dub.

Keys:
E - to toggle from edit mode to game mode

Edit mode only:
B - change brush to what's in the cursor space
V - use brush (see green box bottom left)
S - Save level
L - Load level

Play mode only:
A - reload level (score gets reset for that level)
Cursor keys - move Dasher
Return/Enter - In level completion, move onto next level (loops if you were on last level)

Trouble shooting:
When placing the start position (S), only have one, and save and load when you put it down.
